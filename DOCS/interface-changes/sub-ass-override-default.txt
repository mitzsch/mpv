move 'scale' above 'force' for `sub-ass-override` in documentation as well as code. This more accurately reflects destructiveness of these options.
change `sub-ass-override` default from 'yes' to 'scale'. This should result in no effective changes because 'yes' used to unintentionally do what 'scale' should've done.
change 'u' binding to cycle between 'force' and 'scale', instead of 'force' and 'yes'
